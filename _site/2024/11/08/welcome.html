<p>This is the first blog post for Tridentu 2 ever. However, this isn’t about us.</p>

<p>This is about the future.</p>

<h1 id="the-future-of-tridentu">The future of Tridentu</h1>

<p>In July of 2022, It was decided that Tridentu-RK would be paused.</p>

<p>Tridentu-RK was the KDE version of Tridentu-R. Tridentu-R was (at the time) the</p>

<p><strong>refined</strong> and <strong>newer</strong> version of the original Tridentu (made for BIOS devices).</p>

<p>To start this blog post off, let’s establish the present.</p>

<h2 id="the-present">The present</h2>

<p>Tridentu 2K is the current variant of Tridentu 2.</p>

<p>Tridentu 2 is the 2nd attempt at Tridentu Linux - with lessons from the first and refined versions of the distro.</p>

<p>Tridentu 2 Kryptonite will provide the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An updated kernel</li>
  <li>A package manager for optional packages</li>
  <li>Flatpak support out of the box</li>
  <li>Web browser out of the box (Firefox or Konqueror)</li>
  <li>MTP Support</li>
</ul>

<p>and much more.</p>
