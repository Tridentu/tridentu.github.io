<p>The site has used Cirrus UI for a long time. However, it’s not the most feature-rich experience that it could have.</p>

<p>So, this site is currently being transitioned back to Bootstrap 5.</p>

<h1 id="the-reasoning">The reasoning</h1>

<p>Here are a few of the reasons for the change:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Better features</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Better customization (using CSS variables)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="other-site-news">Other site news</h1>

<p>There are also a few other site-related events happening,  including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A better wiki/documentation page</li>
  <li>more changelogs (between ISO tests)</li>
  <li>more features (to be determined)</li>
</ul>
