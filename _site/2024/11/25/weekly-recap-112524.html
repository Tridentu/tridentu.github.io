<p>One week has passed since the last post. Let’s go over what happened:</p>

<h2 id="test-2-successful">Test 2 Successful</h2>

<p>The second ISO test for Tridentu 2 was a success last Thursday. With a bit of tweaking, one could enter the</p>

<p>system and use it as normal. However, that is inexcusable for a fully working system. Expect the problem to be</p>

<p>resolved next week.</p>

<h2 id="bluetooth-input">Bluetooth input</h2>

<p>Mice and keyboards under Bluetooth now work properly. the kernel has been changed as a result to make this</p>

<p>happen.</p>

<h2 id="touchpad-support">Touchpad support</h2>

<p>Touchpad support is now added to the system. Thanks to a few hints, the issue was resolved on Sunday.</p>

<h2 id="wiki">Wiki</h2>

<p>The wiki has been redesigned as of Sunday. From now on, topics will be covered on it more often, and MkDocs is</p>

<p>used for it’s functionality and design.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>

<h3 id="caravel-repos">Caravel Repos</h3>

<p>Caravel Repository Configs (CRCs) should be creatable (system only), editable and deletable by the end of the</p>

<p>week. These INI files tell Caravel about the repository being referenced in the file. Currently, the CMR is the</p>

<p>only repository out there.</p>

<h2 id="better-installation">Better Installation</h2>

<p>This week wil mark the start of work onthe tridentuinstall program. Also, the Calamares option will have a</p>

<p>better slideshow.</p>
