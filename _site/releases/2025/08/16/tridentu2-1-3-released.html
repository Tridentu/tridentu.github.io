<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Earlier in the month, it was said that there would be <strong>serious</strong> maintenance to this distro. Now, that request has been fulfilled.
Here’s the scoop:</p>

<h2 id="tridentu-2s-earlier-promises">Tridentu 2’s Earlier Promises</h2>

<p>Everything from <a href="2025/08/01/tridentu-1-dot-3-underway.html">This post</a> either was covered or ignored (due to limitations) in this release. No issues there.</p>

<h2 id="new-papirus-folders-kcm">New papirus-folders KCM</h2>

<p>This KCM allows the user to customize their folders’ color from the Papirus them (as well as the Papirus-Dark and/or Papirus-Light themes). IF you change the folder, you should get a notification about it.</p>

<h2 id="hyprland-in-the-cmr">Hyprland in the CMR</h2>

<p>Hyprland is now in the Caravel Main Repository (as well as kitty).</p>

<p>Kitty also replaces Contour, so keep that in mind.</p>

<h2 id="neovim">Neovim</h2>

<p>Tridentu 2 now comes with Neovim out of the box. A kickstart-based config is provided for you to use with Konsole and/or Kitty (via ZSH).</p>

<h1 id="whats-to-come">What’s to come?</h1>

<p>In the future, there will be a Tridentu2-1.4 iso (for KDE and possibly Gnome).
Here’s some of the changes to be anticipated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better ISOing process (no more live kit ramfs, dracut instead)</li>
  <li>Improvements to the Papirus Folders KCM</li>
  <li>Upgrade to 6.4 or 6.5</li>
  <li>Graphite theme (custom due to incompatibilities with the first one)</li>
  <li>A possible sources plugin rewrite for caravel</li>
  <li>Release notes in the installer will be linked to the releases category.</li>
  <li>[CMR] Better support for Hyprland</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="endnotes">Endnotes</h1>

<ul>
  <li>The Tridentu2-1.2.5-kde-amd64 ISO will be removed due to it’s broken state.</li>
  <li>From now on, only two ISOs will remain at a time after each release.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
