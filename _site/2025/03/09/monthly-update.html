<p>It’s been a while since the last post. Let’s go over what’s changed.</p>

<h2 id="btrfs-support">BTRFS Support</h2>

<p>Tridentu 2 now supports BTRFS. Also, there are built-in programs that handle BTRFS (such as BTRFS assistant and grub-btrfs).</p>

<h2 id="new-manual">New Manual</h2>

<p>Tridentu 2 also has a new manual. The manual covers zsh and zshroot (the new zsh environment for zsh on Tridentu 2), BTRFS and more.</p>

<h2 id="caravel-repos">Caravel Repos</h2>

<p>Caravel Repository Configs (CRCs) are now present. These INI files tell Caravel about the repository being referenced in the file. Currently, the CMR is the only repository out there.</p>
