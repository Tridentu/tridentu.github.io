This is the first blog post for Tridentu-R ever. However, this isn't about us.

This is about the future.


# The future of Tridentu

In July of 2022, It was decided that Tridentu-RK would be paused.

Tridentu-RK was the KDE version of Tridentu-R. Tridentu-R was (at the time) the

**refined** and **newer** version of the original Tridentu (made for BIOS devices).

To start this blog post off, let's establish the present.


## The present

Tridentu 2K is the current variant of Tridentu 2.

Tridentu 2 is the 2nd attempt at Tridentu Linux - with lessons from the first and refind versions of the distro.

Tridentu 2 Kryptonite will provide the following:

- An updated kernel
- A package manager for optional packages
- Flatpak support out of the box
- Web browser out of the box (Firefox or Konqueror)
- MTP Support

and much more.
