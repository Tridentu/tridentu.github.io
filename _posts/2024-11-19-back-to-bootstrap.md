The site has used Cirrus UI for a long time. However, it's not the most feature-rich experience that it could have.

So, this site is currently being transitioned back to Bootstrap 5.

# The reasoning

Here are a few of the reasons for the change:

1. Better features

2. More support

3. Better customization (using CSS variables)


# Other site news

There are also a few other site-related events happening,  including:

- A better wiki/documentation page
- more changelogs (between ISO tests)
- more features (to be determined)
