It's been a while since the last post. Let's go over what's changed.

## BTRFS Support

Tridentu 2 now supports BTRFS. Also, there are built-in programs that handle BTRFS (such as BTRFS assistant and grub-btrfs).

## New Manual

Tridentu 2 also has a new manual. The manual covers zsh and zshroot (the new zsh environment for zsh on Tridentu 2), BTRFS and more.

## Caravel Repos

Caravel Repository Configs (CRCs) are now present. These INI files tell Caravel about the repository being referenced in the file. Currently, the CMR is the only repository out there.
