## Important News:

Tridentu 2 GT-1.5 (Graphical Terminal) is currently being worked on. This is the equivalent to Tridentu T and RT editions back in 2021 (they were never released due to being outdated).  Also, the CMR will be wiped of **ALL** packages (including certain ones). New ones will be in place and updated every cycle (whenever the stable LFS book releases). Thank you for your patience.
