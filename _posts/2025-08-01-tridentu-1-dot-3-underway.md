As of July 27th, Tridentu 2 1.2.5 has been released. However, Tridentu 2 1.3 is in the works. Here's what will be different:

## KDE Plasma 6.4

KDE Plasma 6.4 will be used instead of 6.3. Also, the issues that came with the 6.3 upgrade will be remedied as 6.4 **will remain** when developing this version of the distro.

## Better Caravel
Caravel PM's development will continue as planned. Caravel will also receive the following features:

- dependency support
- repo db tools

## Improved Manual
Tridentu 2 1.3 will receive a newer, improved manual that will be more readable and better suited to the distro. It will include information about using Caravel, using the distro's builtin themes (KDE) and more.

## Improved Theming

I will admit, the theming in Tridentu 2 1.2.5 was messy at worst. So, to make up for it, the themes will be handcrafted instead of automated like before. It will also feature a better layout.

## Flatpak Install 

There will be an attempt to add flatpak packages to your copy of Tridentu 2 in 1.3 (via installer). The packages will be handpicked from a group of them and there could even be (depends on the software tested) config packages for customization.

## Touchpad support 

Yes - there will be another attempt to make touchpads work on HP devices.

## Orca (hardbuilt)

Orca will be hardbuilt (installed by default) on Tridentu 2 1.3. That means that out of the box, you get screen reader support for all of your accessibility needs. There might even be SORS installed (plugin system).

There is so much more that could be covered here. However, it would take a while to cover it all, so I'm going to keep it brief. Anyways, that's the scoop on Tridentu 2 (1.2.5 and 1.3).
