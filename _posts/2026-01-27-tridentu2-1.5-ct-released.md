Tridentu 2 1.5 has been initiated and released (CT variant only). This means that you get the following:


- Completely new versions of most software
- New installer (TUI)
- ZRAM swap support
- Networking out of the box

Pretty soon there will be a GT (Graphical, Terminal) and DE-based variants available to download.

Enjoy!
