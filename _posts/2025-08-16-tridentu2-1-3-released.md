title: Tridentu 2 (1.3) Released!
category: releases

---


## Overview

Earlier in the month, it was said that there would be **serious** maintenance to this distro. Now, that request has been fulfilled.
Here's the scoop:

## Tridentu 2's Earlier Promises

Everything from [This post](2025/08/01/tridentu-1-dot-3-underway.html) either was covered or ignored (due to limitations) in this release. No issues there.

## New papirus-folders KCM

This KCM allows the user to customize their folders' color from the Papirus them (as well as the Papirus-Dark and/or Papirus-Light themes). IF you change the folder, you should get a notification about it.

## Hyprland in the CMR

Hyprland is now in the Caravel Main Repository (as well as kitty).

Kitty also replaces Contour, so keep that in mind.

## Neovim

Tridentu 2 now comes with Neovim out of the box. A kickstart-based config is provided for you to use with Konsole and/or Kitty (via ZSH).

# What's to come?

In the future, there will be a Tridentu2-1.4 iso (for KDE and possibly Gnome).
Here's some of the changes to be anticipated:

- Better ISOing process (no more live kit ramfs, dracut instead)
- Improvements to the Papirus Folders KCM
- Upgrade to 6.4 or 6.5
- Graphite theme (custom due to incompatibilities with the first one)
- A possible sources plugin rewrite for caravel
- Release notes in the installer will be linked to the releases category.
- [CMR] Better support for Hyprland


# Endnotes

- The Tridentu2-1.2.5-kde-amd64 ISO will be removed due to it's broken state.
- From now on, only two ISOs will remain at a time after each release.

Enjoy!
