One week has passed since the last post. Let's go over what happened:

## Test 2 Successful

The second ISO test for Tridentu 2 was a success last Thursday. With a bit of tweaking, one could enter the

system and use it as normal. However, that is inexcusable for a fully working system. Expect the problem to be

resolved next week.


## Bluetooth input

Mice and keyboards under Bluetooth now work properly. the kernel has been changed as a result to make this

happen.


## Touchpad support

Touchpad support is now added to the system. Thanks to a few hints, the issue was resolved on Sunday.


## Wiki

The wiki has been redesigned as of Sunday. From now on, topics will be covered on it more often, and MkDocs is

used for it's functionality and design.

## What to Expect

### Caravel Repos

Caravel Repository Configs (CRCs) should be creatable (system only), editable and deletable by the end of the

week. These INI files tell Caravel about the repository being referenced in the file. Currently, the CMR is the

only repository out there.

## Better Installation

This week wil mark the start of work onthe tridentuinstall program. Also, the Calamares option will have a

better slideshow.
